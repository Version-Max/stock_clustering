* ### Goal: Use K-Means clustering to cluster our stock into K clusters

* Stock selection, outlier detection, portfolio creation are important mechanisms for the financial industry to maximize and strategize the right investments in the stock market. Therefore, using certain indicators (often latent factors) we would attempt to cluster the given stocks.

* Clustering will help in pointing common attributes/characteristics they clustered stocks share.
